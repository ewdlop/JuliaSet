## Fractal Dimensions

Fractal dimensions are a measure of the complexity of a fractal. They provide a way to describe how the detail in a fractal pattern changes with the scale at which it is measured. This concept is particularly relevant to Julia sets and Mandelbrot sets, which are both examples of fractals.

### Julia Sets

A Julia set is a set of complex numbers that, when iterated through a specific function, do not escape to infinity. The boundary of a Julia set is a fractal, and its dimension can be calculated using various methods, such as the box-counting dimension or the Hausdorff dimension.

### Mandelbrot Sets

The Mandelbrot set is another example of a fractal. It is defined as the set of complex numbers for which the function does not diverge when iterated from a starting point. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set is also a fractal, and its dimension can be calculated similarly to that of a Julia set.
